This is my try to make John Horton Conway's game of life aka Conway's game of life in python in a donut world i.e the corners wrap around themselves i.e the first and last cell (both columnwise and rowwise) are neighbours just like in a donut

there are just 4 rules which govern this donut world:
1.Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2.Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3.Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4.Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
