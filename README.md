# Conway's Game of Life in a Donut World

This is my attempt to implement John Horton Conway's Game of Life in Python with a twist: the world is shaped like a **donut**! In this version, the edges wrap around, so the first and last cells (both row-wise and column-wise) are considered neighbors, just like in a donut-shaped universe.

## Rules of the Game
The game is governed by four simple rules:
1. **Underpopulation**: Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies.
2. **Survival**: Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives to the next generation.
3. **Overpopulation**: Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies.
4. **Reproduction**: Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
