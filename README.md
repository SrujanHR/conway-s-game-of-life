# Conway's Game of Life in a Donut World

This is my try to make John Horton Conway's game of life aka Conway's game of life in python in a donut world i.e the corners wrap around themselves i.e the first and last cell (both columnwise and rowwise) are neighbours just like in a donut

## Rules of the Game
The game is governed by four simple rules:
1. **Underpopulation**: Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies.
2. **Survival**: Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives to the next generation.
3. **Overpopulation**: Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies.
4. **Reproduction**: Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
